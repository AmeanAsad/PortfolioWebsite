            <div class="subheading mb-3"><a href="https://github.com/AmeanAsad/Syndrome-Error-Decoding" >Github Link </a> </div>
                <p>
                  I developed a class that is able to develop any (n, k) linear code including by generating a generator matrix, parity check matrix, and a syndrome decoding table. I used that class to develop an ASCII code class in order to correct errors in the ascii representation of alphabet letters.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I developed a stochastic simulation in order to test the accuracy of different error correcting codes. This was done by writing a random text generator. I used a 5000 word data set an input to the generator. I used the output from the text generator to feed it into a function that parses the text and transforms it into a vector of binary representations of each character based on it's ASCII representation. I then used a function that randomly distorts bits in each character. From there I was able to apply the linear code to try and retrieve the original text. My simulation focused on measuring the time required for the operation and also the amount of errors that where corrected.

                <p>
                 For one of our design projects in Engineering, we were tasked with implementing multi-agent dynamics to solve a problem. Our group implemented multi agent dynamics on autonomous, decentralized drone agents to optimize aerial wildfire mitigation.  
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the issues we ran into is simulating our algorithm over an actual fire spread. I decided to take the lead on solving this issue. I decided to stochastically model the fire spread using Python, which would allow us to test our algorithm over various fires that are randomly generated. I studied some cellular automaton concepts and modelled the stochastic spread of each cell based on its Moore Neighborhood. I also incorporated some parameters to impact the spread, such as a wind vector field and moisture levels of the terrain. 
                </p>

                <p>
                 I implemented Lloyd’s deployment algorithm in Matlab along with Voronoi tessellations to determine agent movement based on various fire parameters and communication with other agents. Then I wrote a script in Matlab to connect the fire simulation data from Python as an input to the algorithm, and the simulation averaged mitigating 60% of the developed fires using just aerial drones.

                     Our biggest focus for this application was ensuring that we could effectively utilize a user's data to provide the best advice and plans for a banking client. To create an intuitive platform for users of all ages, we created a web-application to ensure that it would be useful for various demographics, and cater to various devices for accessibility. We effectively utilized the Greedy Optimization Algorithm to help interpret the user's data and draw conclusions based upon it. For the analysis of the data, we utilized Python, while using Django and React to relay this information to the consumer. In order to do our initial drafts of our UI, we utilized Figma to effectively visualize our ideas and prepare for actual implementation of the system.

This was definitely a lifesaver in order to ensure that our solution was scalable and useful to create reports and recommendations based on each situation.

       <div class="subheading mb-3"> Machine Learning and Data Science </div>

       <p> Algorithms in general have been my main interest in programming since I started learning it, mainly because they are intellectually challenging. I took a few online courses to introduce myself to basic algorithmic thinkning and started getting into more advanced computations and data science. A big part of my learning process is working on projects to apply the theory I learn. Some of my favorite projects I have worked on mainly involve optimization problems and stochastic simulations. I have a tradition where every year I choose one of the challenging concepts I learn in university and try to write a program revolving around the concept (Eg: Syndrome Error Decoding Project). Python is my favorite coding language for any computational problems I deal with, because of how easy it is to translate your thought into code due to the simple syntax. </p>

       <p> Following my interest in algorithms, I naturally took a leap into machine learning. It really complements my mathematics and computer engineering degree. I am really fascinated on how much impact simple machine learning algorithms can do, and I am very absorbed into learning the mathematics behind every algorithm. </p>

        <p>I enjoy working on building web applications. I am more interested in the backend and serverside portion of applications. My favorite development framework is Django using Python. Building modularized backends with Django is very efficient. I think that the Django Rest Framework is also excellent to use for projects that involve high frequency data transfers and secure authentication. Learning serverside coding has enabled me to work on projects that involve real time data updates. </p>

        <p>React.js is my most used fron-end framework. It is simple, fast, and scalable, which makes it my go to framework for most web application projects. It also has many open source libraries which really accelerates my development process.   </p>

       <div class="subheading mb-3"> Other Interests and Hobbies </div>

      <p> I'm very intrigued by flight, and one of my hobbies is designing and building RC Airplanes when I have the time. I am also a huge fan of watching and playing football(soccer for all the North Americans). Sometimes I do some stand up comedy shows in my university, and I certainly go watch live comedy whenever I can.  </p>
